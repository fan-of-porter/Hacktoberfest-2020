Floyd's triangle, named after Rober Floyd, is a right angled triangle, which is made using natural numbers. It starts from 1 and consecutively selects the next greater number in sequence.

Floyds Triangle
We shall here learn how to print floyd's triangle using C programming language.

Algorithm
Algorithm should look like this −

Step 1 - Take number of rows to be printed, n.
Step 2 - Make outer iteration I for n times to print rows
Step 3 - Make inner iteration for J to I
Step 3 - Print K
Step 4 - Increment K
Step 5 - Print NEWLINE character after each inner iteration
Step 6 - Return
Pseudocode
We can derive a pseudocode for the above mentioned algorithm, as follows −

procedure floyds_triangle

   FOR I = 1 to N DO
      FOR J = 1 to I DO
         PRINT K
         INCREMENT K
      END FOR
      PRINT NEWLINE
   END FOR

end procedure
Implementation
Implementation of right triangle in C is as follows −

 Live Demo
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int n,i,j,k = 1;

   n = 5;

   for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      for(j = 1;j <= i; j++)
         printf("%3d", k++);

      printf("\n");
   }

   return 0;
}
The output should look like this −

  1
  2  3
  4  5  6
  7  8  9 10
 11 12 13 14 15
